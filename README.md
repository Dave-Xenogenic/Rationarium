# Rationarium
A cloud based, book keeping and accountancy package, written in PHP.

# Whats a Rationarium?
Noun - ratiōnārium n ‎(genitive ratiōnāriī); second declension
statistical table, schedule
account book, ledger
official account, accounting, summary

# Why?
In our company we prefer to use open source software. However the accountancy packages that are currently available leave a lot to be desired for the professional book keeper.

# Why cloud?
In terms of the skills we have available to work on this project, writing for web will enable us to turn it around a lot faster. We also require the finished product to be able to handle multiple book keepers, working on the same books at the same time.
